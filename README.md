# Restaurant
This is a front page react app to simply order some food and add it to a cart, you can then add more items of the food you got or delete some of it.

This is an ongoing project while i learn how to merge the backend with the frontend. Maybe even later i will add a payment process, but this is (until now) a work in progress.

#Live Demo
